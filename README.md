## Topic: Gender Gap in The Film Industry Through the Years

### Research
For this project, I am seeking to address the manner in which women have been represented in the film industry changed over time (roles, financing, Box office). How have these changes look when comparing films, not in English?

### Motivation
My motivation in doing so relies mainly on the fact as someone who identifies as a woman of color, I have always seen a gender gap in environments in most professional spaces I come across ranging from higher education to the world of entertainment. Though I have seen such spaces become more gender inclusive with time, I wish to see how the film industry specifically has improved. Additionally, how has Hollywood worked to include non-English speaking countries through time?

### Sources 
Dataset: https://github.com/taubergm/HollywoodGenderData/blob/master/all_actors_movies_gender_gold.csv

In this project, I am using the “All_actors_movies_gender_gold” dataset provided by user taubergm on GitHub. Containing hundreds of rows of data from 2000 to 2018, this dataset features several variables such as Film titles, country/language, financials, and cast information such as lead actor or actress and most importantly their gender.
