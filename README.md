Ideas for data to investigate for Digital Humanities project

### Topics:

#### 1. Ethnic/gender disparity in different fields (academic, entertainment, workforce, political, etc.)
This interests me because as a woman of color I grew up not seeing characters who looked or had similar backgrounds as me. With time there seems to have been an increase in these characters and their stories but I would like to see what the ratio looks like more in depth. Possible source: *["Using data science to understand the film industry’s gender gap."
](https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-020-0436-1)*

#### 2. Globalization/Transcultural Development
Possible source: *["Transcultural identity development among third generation minority consumers"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2021.04.060)*

#### 3.  Social Influence, Consumer Behavior 
Possible source: *["Understanding online consumers’ purchase intentions: a contribution from social network theory"](https://doi.org/10.1080/0144929X.2018.1456563)*

#### Data Visualizations
I am most drawn to network and text analysis. The reason being that I like to be able to see how something such as a product or idea spreads throughout a netwrok and using text analysis being able to get an idea as to how people are feeling and make predictions off of that. Furthermore, its ability to showcase the relationships and oftentimes its strength across a network of people or entities.
