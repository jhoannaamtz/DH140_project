# DH140_project Topic: Gender Gap in The Film Industry Through the Years

### Introduction
Throughout the years, films have made their way to become one of the most popular forms of entertainment in the present day going so far as to become essential in the formation of pop culture. As shown by the massive growth in the box office domestically, the last decade has proven to be the most successful in film history so far. However, despite this tremendous financial growth, the same cannot be said for gender inclusion in Hollywood.

### Research Question
For this project, I seek to address the manner in which women have been represented in the film industry changed over time, particularly in the roles of writers, cast members, producers, and writers.

### Motivation
My motivation in doing so relies mainly on the fact as someone who identifies as a woman of color, I have always seen a gender gap in environments in most professional spaces I come across ranging from higher education to the world of entertainment. Though I have seen such spaces become more gender inclusive with time, I wish to see how the film industry specifically has improved. Additionally, how has Hollywood worked to include non-English speaking countries through time?
