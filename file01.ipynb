    "\n",
    "### Research\n",
    "For this project, I am seeking to address the manner in which women have been represented in the film industry changed over time (roles, financing, Box office). How have these changes look when comparing films, not in English?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "My motivation in doing so relies mainly on the fact as someone who identifies as a woman of color, I have always seen a gender gap in environments in most professional spaces I come across ranging from higher education to the world of entertainment. Though I have seen such spaces become more gender inclusive with time, I wish to see how the film industry specifically has improved. Additionally, how has Hollywood worked to include non-English speaking countries through time?\n",

Containing hundreds of rows of data from 2000 to 2018, this dataset features several variables such as Film titles, country/language, financials, and cast information such as lead actor or actress and most importantly their gender."

    "As mentioned above this dataset is compiled of several variables such as Year and Date of Release, Film Name, Country, Budget/Gross (stop at September 2018), Film Runtime, Film Cast and Gender. This said, gender is categorized into a binary meaning cast members who may not feel identified by either category might be left out or misgendered. Additonally, it does not capture intersecting film cast identities such as gender and ethnicity.\n",
